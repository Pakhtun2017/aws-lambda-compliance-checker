Python script that checks AWS Lambda functions for compliance with certain standards, integrating this script into a GitHub Actions workflow can provide significant benefits for maintaining code quality, security, and operational standards. Automatically runs the compliance checks every time new code is pushed to the repository or a pull request is made. This ensures that any changes to Lambda functions or related AWS resources adhere to your compliance standards before they are merged into the main branch. Provides immediate feedback on compliance issues, preventing non-compliant code from being deployed.
